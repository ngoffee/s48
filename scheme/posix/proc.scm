;   program: byte vector, name of file or program
;   lookup?: should the program be looked up in PATH?
;   environment: either #f, which uses the parent's environment in the child,
;            or a list of byte vectors, representing text of the form "name=value".
;   arguments: a list of byte vectors

; of arguments.

; When given, ENV should be a list of strings of the form "name=value".
